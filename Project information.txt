Background
According to Wikipedia Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was developed by Phil Zimmermann in 1991
to provide cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. This resulted
in a secure communcations platform. 

Problem
Although PGP created a platform where information could only be read by the intended receiptent,
it had no way of automatically deleted the information if the information was develivered to
the wrong receiptent. Thereofre messages that were not delivered to the correct receiptent would
have the possbility of being decrypted by brute force unless the unintended receiptent deletes
the information.

Solution - Project Goal
I plan to use to use smart contracts to ensure messages that are sent from one person is 
only read by the right person and if not it the message will be return to the sender as
message undeliver if the intended receiptent does not validate the contract within a specific
time period agreed upon between the two parties.
